# Global CO2 from Cement Production Dataset

This repository downloads the Andrew dataset on global CO2 emissions from cement production from Zenodo.

## Description

This repository downloads data on global CO2 emissions from cement production from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10008931).
The downloaded dataset can then be converted into CSV (.csv file extension) or NetCDF (.nc file extension) format.
The data management tool [DataLad](http://docs.datalad.org/en/stable/) is used to version control the data sets.
Commands to run the scripts are executed via the pydoit package.

### Installation

- Install datalad according to the [DataLad handbook](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html). It is recommended to install globally. 
- DataLad is based on Git. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) needs to be installed to run DataLad. 
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [pydoit](https://pydoit.org/install.html)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

Download the repository using the following command.
```
datalad clone
```
Do not use **git clone** to download the repository! This way DataLad will not have the necessary
information to run the program.

### 2. Easy Access
Users who simply want to download the dataset have the option to access both the
original and extracted files with the following command.
```
dataland get <filename>
```
For example, the CSV file for the 2023/09/13 release can be downloaded with:
```
datalad get extracted_data/v230913/Robbie_Andrew_Cement_Production_CO2_230913.csv 
```


### 3. Executing the program

#### 3.1 Set up the virtual environment with doit
```
doit setup_env
```
#### <a name="download"></a> 3.2 Download the version from the command line.
This will download all files from Zenodo as they are.
```
doit download_version --version <YYMMDD>
```
#### <a name="convert"></a> 3.3 Convert the data sets into CSV and NetCDF files.
```
doit read_version --version <YYMMDD>
```

## <a name="newversion"></a> How to add a new version


1. To add a new version go to **versions.py** in the **src** directory and create a new value in the
dictionary. Fill all the required information similar to the previous entries.
For example, the value _v230913_ in the _versions_ dictionary describes the 13-Sep-2023 release.
````python
versions = {
    "v230913": {
        'date': '13-Sep-2023',
        'ver_str_long': 'version 230913',
        'ver_str_short': '230913',
        "folder": "v230913",
        "transpose": False,
        "filename": "0. GCP-CEM.csv",
        'ref': '10.5281/zenodo.8339353',
        'ref2': '10.5194/essd-11-1675-2019',
        'title': 'Global CO2 emissions from cement production',
        'institution': "CICERO - Center for International Climate Research",
        'filter_keep': {},
        'filter_remove': {},
        'contact': "johannes.guetschow@climate-resource.com",
        'comment': ("Published by Robbie Andrew, converted to PRIMAP2 format by "
                    "Johannes GÃ¼tschow"),
        'unit': 'kt * CO2 / year',
        'country_code': True,
    },
}
````

2. Then run the two commands as described in [3.2] and [3.3].

## For developers
### Repository structure
- **.datalad/** contains config file for datalad
- **downloaded_data/** contains original data from Zenodo.
- **extracted_data/** contains data in .csv and .nc format
- **literature/** contains link to publication by Robbie M. Andrew. Can be downloaded with _datalad get_ command
- **src/** 
  - **download_version.py** downloads files from zenodo for a given version. The version to read will be taken from the command line using _argparse_.
  - **download_version_datalad.py** calls datalad to run the data reading function.
  - **helper_functions.py** contains a function to map country codes.
  - **read_version.py** reads the data for a given version and saves to [PRIMAP2](https://primap2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) native and
    interchange format.
  - **read_version_datalad.py** calls datalad to run the data reading function.
  - **version.py** is a dictionary that contains metadata for each release. This file should be updated when [adding a new version](#a-namenewversiona-how-to-add-a-new-version) 
- **dodo.py** defines pydoit commands.
- **pyproject.toml** configuration file
- **requirements.txt** requirements
- **requirements_dev.txt** development requirements
- **setup.cfg** requirements
- **setup.py** installs python packages

### Make sure to connect with your siblings
Git repositories can configure clones of a dataset as _remotes_ in order to fetch, pull, or push from and to them. A `datalad sibling` is the equivalent of a git clone that is configured as a remote. 

**Query information** about about all known siblings with: 
```
datalad siblings
```

**Add a sibling** to allow pushing to github:
```
datalad siblings add --dataset . --name <name> --url git@github.com:JGuetschow/Global_CO2_from_cement_production.git
```
SSH-access is needed to run this command. Note that _name_ can be freely chosen. 

**Push to the github repository**
```
datalad push --to <name>

```

# About this dataset

## General information

This is a DataLad dataset (id: 24f90b12-e4a9-4e2c-995d-a54ed4cd49c7).

## DataLad datasets and how to use them

This repository is a [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) dataset. It provides
fine-grained data access down to the level of individual files, and allows for
tracking future updates. In order to use this repository for data retrieval,
[DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) is required. It is a free and open source
command line tool, available for all major operating systems, and builds up on
Git and [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/) to allow sharing,
synchronizing, and version controlling collections of large files.

More information on how to install DataLad and [how to install](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html)
it can be found in the [DataLad Handbook](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/index.html).

### Get the dataset

A DataLad dataset can be `cloned` by running

```
datalad clone <url>
```

Once a dataset is cloned, it is a light-weight directory on your local machine.
At this point, it contains only small metadata and information on the identity
of the files in the dataset, but not actual *content* of the (sometimes large)
data files.

### Retrieve dataset content

After cloning a dataset, you can retrieve file contents by running

```
datalad get <path/to/directory/or/file>
```

This command will trigger a download of the files, directories, or subdatasets
you have specified.

DataLad datasets can contain other datasets, so called *subdatasets*.  If you
clone the top-level dataset, subdatasets do not yet contain metadata and
information on the identity of files, but appear to be empty directories. In
order to retrieve file availability metadata in subdatasets, run

```
datalad get -n <path/to/subdataset>
```

Afterwards, you can browse the retrieved metadata to find out about subdataset
contents, and retrieve individual files with `datalad get`.  If you use
`datalad get <path/to/subdataset>`, all contents of the subdataset will be
downloaded at once.

### Stay up-to-date

DataLad datasets can be updated. The command `datalad update` will *fetch*
updates and store them on a different branch (by default
`remotes/origin/master`). Running

```
datalad update --merge
```

will *pull* available updates and integrate them in one go.

### Find out what has been done

DataLad datasets contain their history in the ``git log``.  By running ``git
log`` (or a tool that displays Git history) in the dataset or on specific
files, you can find out what has been done to the dataset or to individual
files by whom, and when.
